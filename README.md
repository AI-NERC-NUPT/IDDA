# IDDA

Implementation of Iterative Discriminative Domain Adapation, submitted for possible publication and will be available soon. 
Codes are based on the implementation of https://github.com/ksaito-ut/atda. 

#Prerequisites
These codes work on Tensorflow 1.3.0 and Python3.4

#Download
Datasets include svhn, mnist, place them into yourpath/data/svhn or mnist

#Run
Run the unsupervised domain adaptation from mnist to svhn by:
 
 python3  mnist2svhn_unsup.py
